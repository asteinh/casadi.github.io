# Support

## Community
If you find simple bugs or lack some feature that you think would be relatively easy for us to add, the simplest thing is simply to write to the [forum](https://github.com/casadi/casadi/discussions). We read the forum post regularly and try to respond as soon as possible. The only thing we expect for this kind of support is that you [cite us](../publications), whenever you use CasADi in scientific work.
There is also an onboarding guide with FAQ over at the [CasADi wiki](https://github.com/casadi/casadi/wiki)

## Academic cooperation
If you want more help, we are always open for *academic* cooperation. Please contact us directly if you want to include us in a grant proposal for academic research.

## Professional cooperation
Both main developers offer professional CasADi-related consulting (e.g. teaching, problem solving, adding features).
