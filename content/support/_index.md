#### Community
If you find simple bugs or lack some feature that you think would be relatively easy for us to add, the simplest thing is simply to write to the [forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/casadi-users). We read the forum post regularly and try to respond as soon as possible. The only thing we expect for this kind of support is that you *cite us*, whenever you use CasADi in scientific work.

#### Cooperation
If you want more help, we are always open for *academic or industrial cooperation*. An academic cooperation usually take the form of a co-authorship of a journal paper, and an industrial cooperation involves a negotiated consulting contract. Please contact us directly if you are interested in this.

#### Professional
Contact details for professional support:
Joris Gillis works via a Belgian BVBA company [yacoda](http://www.yacoda.com/)
