# Source

## Outline

CasADi is written in modern C++ code, and licensed under the LGPL, meaning the code can be used royalty-free even in commercial applications.
Interfaces to other Python, Octave, Matlab are provided through [SWIG](http://www.swig.org).

## Source builds
The source code is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/casadi/casadi).
While the core depends only on the C++ Standard Library, [source builds](https://github.com/casadi/casadi/wiki/SourceBuild) can be daunting because of the interfaces to numerical codes. We highly recommend following the [Try/install page](../get) instead.

## Developers
It is developed by [Joel Andersson](https://wid.wisc.edu/people/joel-andersson/), [Joris Gillis](https://www.mech.kuleuven.be/en/pma/research/meco/people/00052373) and Greg Horn, initially at the [Optimization in Engineering Center, OPTEC](https://set.kuleuven.be/optec) of KU Leuven under supervision of Moritz Diehl.
