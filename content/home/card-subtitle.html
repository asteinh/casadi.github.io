<div class="row subtitle">
  <p>CasADi is an <em>open-source</em> tool for <em>nonlinear optimization</em> and <em>algorithmic differentiation</em>.</p>
</div>


<div>
CasADi <em>facilitates</em> rapid &mdash; yet efficient &mdash; implementation of different methods for numerical <em>optimal control</em> (OCP), both in an offline context and for nonlinear <em>model predictive control</em> (NMPC).<br/>
A detailed description of the tool and its implementation can be found in a recent paper in <em>Mathematical Programming Computation</em> (<a href="http://paper.casadi.org">preprint</a>). Please <a href="about">cite</a> this paper if you use CasADi in your academic work.
