CasADi is an open-source tool, written in self-contained C++ code, depending only on the C++ Standard Library. It is developed by Joel Andersson and Joris Gillis at the Optimization in Engineering Center, OPTEC of the K.U. Leuven under supervision of Moritz Diehl.
CasADi is distributed under the LGPL license, meaning the code can be used royalty-free even in commercial applications.
